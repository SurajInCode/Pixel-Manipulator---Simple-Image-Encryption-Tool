# Pixel Manipulator - Simple Image Encryption Tool

Pixel Manipulator is a Python-based tool that allows you to encrypt and decrypt images using pixel manipulation techniques. It utilizes a simple mathematical operation on pixel values to secure your images.

## Key Features

- **Image Encryption & Decryption**: Easily encrypt and decrypt images using a customizable key.
- **Support for Various Image Formats**: Works with popular image formats like PNG and JPEG.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A command-line interface for easy operation.

## How It Works

1. **Encryption**: The tool reads an image, manipulates its pixel values based on a specified key, and saves the encrypted image.
2. **Decryption**: It reverses the process, allowing users to retrieve the original image using the same key.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pixel-manipulator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd pixel-manipulator
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Choose an option**: 
   - **Encrypt an image**
   - **Decrypt an image**
   - **Exit**

3. **Follow the prompts to select an image and enter the encryption/decryption key.**
